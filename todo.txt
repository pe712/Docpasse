- clean configuration of mysql server
- reorganize files either :
      + use a framework (symfony)
      + use existing work done for course-drapeaux.binets.fr (but not very qualitative)
      
 configure mail server -> essential for account settings
 (need to configure also DNS zone)
 
 if everything is working, try doing the same using docker
