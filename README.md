# Docpasse  
Docpasse is a password manager. It securely encrypt the user data by using its master password as a key.
The server does not store any critical information. Even if the data is leaked, without the user's password, a malicious person cannot do anything.  

## The project âœ¨  
This project is one of my first projects. It needs a lot a refactoring and cleaning. It is not safe now and should not be used.

The objective is to create a safe, easy-to-use password manager that is free. Currently the market does not offer free password manager without limitations in the number of passwords or things like that.

This project has been thought more for a personnal use. I am not more trustfull than any password manager right?
